# 🧪 Physics Simulations App

Welcome to the interactive physics simulations app! 🚀

This project lets you explore and visualize four classic physical systems in a fun and graphical way:

1. **Spring Simulation** 🪀
2. **Pendulum Simulation** 🕰️
3. **Double Pendulum** 🌀
4. **2D Waves** 🌊

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. **Install the dependencies**

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pygame pygame_gui numpy
```

### 2. **Run the main app**

```bash
python main.py
```

A window will open with a menu to choose the simulation you want to try. Just click the corresponding button and enjoy! 😃

## 🕹️ Controls & Features for Each Simulation

### 🪀 **Spring**
- Adjust mass, spring constant, and gravity with sliders.
- Buttons to start/stop and reset.

### 🕰️ **Pendulum**
- Control the mass with a slider.
- Buttons to start/stop and reset.

### 🌀 **Double Pendulum**
- Control the mass of the second pendulum with a slider.
- Buttons to start/stop and reset.
- Watch chaotic trajectories!

### 🌊 **2D Waves**
- Click to create disturbances on the surface.
- Press `Space` to pause/resume.
- Press `R` to reset the simulation.
